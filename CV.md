Hack The Box Academy May 2025 – Present
_Cybersecurity Trainee_

- Completed Hack The Box job-role paths: Penetration Tester and Junior Cybersecurity Analyst, with hands-on
  labs covering the full assessment workflow from reconnaissance to reporting.
- Focus areas proved by completed paths and modules: web exploitation (auth/session testing, input validation,
  XSS/SQLi, IDOR), Active Directory enumeration and attack paths, Linux/Windows privilege escalation,
  password/authentication attacks, network enumeration and traffic analysis.
- Outcomes: produced step-by-step write-ups, PoCs, and reusable playbooks; standardized checklists and report
  snippets aligned with OWASP WSTG/Top 10 and ATT&CK; practiced detection-aware operations and basic
  OPSEC in lab environments.
- Tooling practiced: Kali Linux, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, ffuf, sqlmap, John
  the Ripper, Hashcat, Nessus, BloodHound, Impacket; automation with Python and Bash.

### WORK EXPERIENCE

German Aerospace Center (DLR) Aug. 202 4 – Nov. 2024
_Cybersecurity Research Intern Munich, Germany_

- Conducted an offensive protocol assessment of SpaceWire, enumerated trust boundaries, and identified missing
  authentication/encryption and protocol weaknesses; outlined paths and mitigations.
- Built an adversary-centric threat model and attack-surface map for on-board networks; profiled attacker
  capabilities and preconditions to prioritize likely exploitation chains.
- Implemented adversary emulation in OMNeT++ to replay, spoof, inject, and disrupt traffic; captured evidence
  to demonstrate impact on integrity, availability and command authenticity.

Saportif Technology Inc. Oct. 2020 – Sep. 2023
_IoT Systems Engineer / Sep. 2022 – Sep. 2023 Istanbul, Turkey_

- Developed an end-to-end IoT system with ESP32 and Raspberry Pi for a smart door-lock in shared offices,
  integrating sensors, actuators, RFID access control, and cloud-backed web interfaces.
- Secured the integration layer with HTTPS/TLS and authenticated REST APIs; mapped RFID identities to role-
  based access control and enforced server-side authorization for bookings and device commands.
- Implemented input validation, parameterized requests, rate limiting, and audit logging; documented issues using
  OWASP Top 10 categories to prioritize remediation.

_Full-Stack Developer / Oct. 2020 – Sep. 2022 Istanbul, Turkey_

- Built and maintained React and Node services with secure-by-default patterns and peer code reviews.
- Implemented authentication and session controls (RBAC, JWT, secure cookies), CSRF protection, and XSS
  mitigations including output encoding and CSP.
- Hardened REST APIs with input validation, parameterized queries, security headers, and structured error
  handling; controls aligned with OWASP Top 10 and WSTG.

Arcelik Inc. Jul. 2022 – Sep. 2022
_Software Engineer Intern Istanbul, Turkey_

- Built a Python test library that created a software-based virtual testing environment and removed reliance on
  hardware simulators.
- Achieved approximately 80% faster test execution on refrigerator control boards with reusable, automated test
  algorithms.

PROJECTS (^)
Physical Adversarial Attacks Using Fan-Based Holographic Projections May 2025 – Nov. 2025

- Planned and executed black-box security testing of traffic sign computer-vision pipelines; produced a threat
  model and attack-surface analysis for safety-critical scenarios.
- Built a programmable hardware proof of concept with a holographic POV fan and a repeatable test harness to
  run real-time experiments and collect evidence for vulnerability assessment.
- Quantified evasion/misclassification across lighting, distance, and angle, achieving up to 90% misclassification;
  delivered steps to reproduce, PoCs, and prioritized mitigations, and documented residual risk.

ESP8266 Ad Hoc Mesh for Real-Time Swarm Coordination Oct. 2022 – Jul. 202 3

- Built a decentralized ad hoc mesh using ESP8266 & ESP-NOW, removing the ground-station dependency via
  peer-to-peer links
- Designed and implemented a real-time swarm coordination algorithm for dynamic environments and multi-
  node operation.
- Evaluated communication reliability and latency under varying node counts and mobility; documented results
  and limitations.
