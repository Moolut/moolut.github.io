### Work Experience

**German Aerospace Center (DLR)** - Cybersecurity Research Intern _(Aug. 2024 – Nov. 2024)_

- Conducted an offensive protocol assessment of SpaceWire, enumerated trust boundaries, and identified missing authentication/encryption and protocol weaknesses; outlined paths and mitigations
- Built an adversary-centric threat model and attack-surface map for on-board networks; profiled attacker capabilities and preconditions to prioritize likely exploitation chains
- Implemented adversary emulation in OMNeT++ to replay, spoof, inject, and disrupt traffic; captured evidence to demonstrate impact on integrity, availability and command authenticity

**Saportif Technology Inc.** - IoT Systems Engineer _(Sep. 2022 – Sep. 2023)_

- Developed an end-to-end IoT system with ESP32 and Raspberry Pi for a smart door-lock in shared offices, integrating sensors, actuators, RFID access control, and cloud-backed web interfaces
- Secured the integration layer with HTTPS/TLS and authenticated REST APIs; mapped RFID identities to role-based access control and enforced server-side authorization for bookings and device commands
- Implemented input validation, parameterized requests, rate limiting, and audit logging; documented issues using OWASP Top 10 categories to prioritize remediation

**Saportif Technology Inc.** - Full-Stack Developer _(Oct. 2020 – Sep. 2022)_

- Built and maintained React and Node services with secure-by-default patterns and peer code reviews
- Implemented authentication and session controls (RBAC, JWT, secure cookies), CSRF protection, and XSS mitigations including output encoding and CSP
- Hardened REST APIs with input validation, parameterized queries, security headers, and structured error handling; controls aligned with OWASP Top 10 and WSTG

**Arcelik Inc.** - Software Engineer Intern _(Jul. 2022 – Sep. 2022)_

- Built a Python test library that created a software-based virtual testing environment and removed reliance on hardware simulators
- Achieved approximately 80% faster test execution on refrigerator control boards with reusable, automated test algorithms

### Projects

**Physical Adversarial Attacks Using Fan-Based Holographic Projections** _(May 2025 – Nov. 2025)_

- Planned and executed black-box security testing of traffic sign computer-vision pipelines; produced a threat model and attack-surface analysis for safety-critical scenarios
- Built a programmable hardware proof of concept with a holographic POV fan and a repeatable test harness to run real-time experiments and collect evidence for vulnerability assessment
- Quantified evasion/misclassification across lighting, distance, and angle, achieving up to 90% misclassification; delivered steps to reproduce, PoCs, and prioritized mitigations

**ESP8266 Ad Hoc Mesh for Real-Time Swarm Coordination** _(Oct. 2022 – Jul. 2023)_

- Built a decentralized ad hoc mesh using ESP8266 & ESP-NOW, removing the ground-station dependency via peer-to-peer links
- Designed and implemented a real-time swarm coordination algorithm for dynamic environments and multi-node operation
- Evaluated communication reliability and latency under varying node counts and mobility; documented results and limitations

### Honors & Awards

- **IOTSEC CTF I** – 1st place, TUM 2024
- **IOTSEC CTF II** – 2nd place, TUM 2024
